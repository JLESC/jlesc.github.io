abstract = {This article presents our work toward correct and efficient automatic differentiation of OpenMP parallel worksharing loops in forward and reverse mode. Automatic differentiation is a method to obtain gradients of numerical programs, which are crucial in optimization, uncertainty quantification, and machine learning. The computational cost to compute gradients is a common bottleneck in practice. For applications that are parallelized for multicore CPUs or GPUs using OpenMP, one also wishes to compute the gradients in parallel. We propose a framework to reason about the correctness of the generated derivative code, from which we justify our OpenMP extension to the differentiation model. We implement this model in the automatic differentiation tool Tapenade and present test cases that are differentiated following our extended differentiation procedure. Performance of the generated derivative programs in forward and reverse mode is better than sequential, although our reverse mode often scales worse than the input programs.},

@article{Higashida2024,
abstract = {The robustness of an artificial neural network that performs model order reduction for flow field data is studied. The network is trained with a large-scale distributed learning approach using up to 6, 259 nodes of the supercomputer Fugaku. Flow around two square cylinders with a varying distance between their centers is investigated. The network is trained and tested with data from numerical simulations. First, the capability to reproduce flow fields with 2, 12, and 24 modes is investigated by comparing the reconstructed flow data to simulated data. It is shown, that reconstructions based on 2 modes cannot capture both, low- and high-frequency flow structures correctly, whereas predictions based on 12 and 24 modes yield improved flow fields, especially in the case of high-frequency waves in the vicinity of the square cylinders. Reconstructions with 24 modes provide smooth velocity fields that reproduce all relevant low- and high-frequency waves for all variations of the distance between the two square cylinders. Second, the performance of the machine learning-based reconstructions are compared to proper orthogonal decomposition, which is a commonly used reduced order model technique. The comparison only includes flow fields based on 24 modes. For all geometric variations, the mean squared errors of the reconstructions by the conventional method are higher than those of the machine learning model. This underlines the advantage of artificial neural networks over linear methods like proper orthogonal decomposition for tasks like reconstructing flow fields that are characterized by non-linear governing equations.},
