% The entries in this file are sorted by YEAR (ascending).

%
% ALSO NOTE:
%
% Please, stick to the following formatting convention to easy maintainability:
%
% - indent keys of entries with 2 spaces (NOT tabs!)
%
% - order the keys alphabetical
%
% - enclose all values within curly brakets '{...}'
%
% - do line breaks at 100 chars; this is ................................................. here -->|
%
% - and add a continuation indent of 2 after line breaks
%
% - put a colon ',' as well after the last key/value pair of an entry
%
%
% Please, treat this file not different from usual source code files.
%
% Thus, stick to the concisely used formatting pattern with tab indention, lower cased keywords,
% curly brackets for value enclosure and alphabetical sorted keywords within one BibTeX entry.
