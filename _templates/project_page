===============================
=== HOWTO USE THIS TEMPLATE ===
===============================

Copy this file to `_projects` and rename it to a very short version of your project's title, e.g.
the project "Scalability Enhancements to FMM for Molecular Dynamics Simulations" chooses
"fmm_project.md".

Also copy the file `_templates/project.bib` to `_bibliography/external` and name it exactly as this
one, but the file extension, e.g. "fmm_project.bib".

!IMPORTANT!
Remember to adjust the file name of the BibTeX file at the very bottom of this file!!

Then fill in the YAML header variables above.

- title
  The full title of the project

- date
  The date this page was created in the format: YYYY-MM-DD.
  This will get displayed at the very bottom of the generated website.

- updated
  In case you or somebody else came back later and edited significant parts of the page, put in the
  date (format: YYYY-MM-DD) of that change.
  If present, this will get displayed at the very bottom of the generated website.
