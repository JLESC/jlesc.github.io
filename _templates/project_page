=== HOW TO USE THIS TEMPLATE ===
================================

Copy this file to `_projects` and rename it to a very short version of your project's title, e.g.
the project "Scalability Enhancements to FMM for Molecular Dynamics Simulations" chooses
"fmm_project.md".

Also copy the file `_templates/project.bib` to `_bibliography/external` and name it exactly as this
one, but the file extension, e.g. "fmm_project.bib".

For citing references, use the Liquid citing syntax as explained in the wiki:
https://github.com/JLESC/jlesc.github.io/wiki/Markup-Language#cite-and-list-publications

!IMPORTANT!
Remember to adjust the file name of the BibTeX file at the very bottom of this file!!
