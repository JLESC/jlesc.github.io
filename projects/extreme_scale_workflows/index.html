<p>The goal of the Swift/Decaf/Damaris/FlowVR collaboration is to enhance the programmability of advanced applications composed of simulation and analysis modules. The Decaf project (Peterka), primarily funded by the U.S. Dept. of Energy, is developing a transport layer, high-level data flow primitives (selection, aggregation, pipelining, and buffering), and a high-level data description layer.  Swift (Wozniak), funded through Argonne LDRD, offers a rich, implicitly parallel programming language and scalable, load-balanced runtime.  Damaris (Antoniu) provides asynchronous resources (dedicated cores/nodes) that can be used for I/O, analysis, and visualization. FlowVR (Raffin) is a generic framework for building complex dataflows by plugging components into a Python interface. We intend to compare and contrast these tools and combine some of them to investigate computer science challenges in creating a highly useful, efficient analysis system.</p>

<p>We are investigating potential convergences between distributed workflows (or wide area workflows) and in situ workflows. PyCommps is a workflow  engine developed at BSC aiming at coordinating the execution of jobs in a wide area. Data exchanges between tasks are done through files. This approach is very convenient for wide areas but are not suitable for HPC resources. Decaf is a runtime to describe and execute in situ workflows. Decaf focuses on coordinating tasks running on the same cluster or data-center. In this context data are exchanged through memory or high performance networks. We are currently building prototypes combining both runtimes where a Decaf workflow is an individual task in a PyCommps workflow. The objective is to automate the full science pipeline to discovery by merging high performance in situ workflows (Decaf) with traditional post-processing methods into a single workflow (PyCommps).</p>

<ul>
  <li>Tom Peterka, Matthieu Dreher and Justin Wozniak of ANL</li>
</ul>

<p>In the first stage, the goal is for swift to be able to execute Decaf workflow as a task. The resources are allocated by Swift and given to the Decaf runtime. We built a first prototype for a simple workflow composed of two tasks exchanging data. The long term objective is for Swift and Decaf to be able to exchange the graph information so that a user could build the graph of the workflow in the Swift language. Another long term objective is for Swift to use Bredala, the data model library of Decaf, to exchange data in parallel between tasks.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Bruno Raffin, INRIA and Matthieu Dreher of ANL</li>
</ul>

<p>Current In Situ infrastructures adopt very often a fixed policy to manage mismatch data rates between parallel tasks exchanging data. If the consumer is too slow,  a policy might be to hold the producer, slowing down the whole pipeline to the slowest component, or to drop an entire frame. FlowVR communication channels are FIFO by default as well, meaning that overflows could happen as well.  However, FlowVR provides components called filters and synchronizer to create more complex sampling policies. We are building a communication library based on the same principles as the components of FlowVR with several improvements: 1) Possibility to buffer data in several memory layers, 2) Buffering done synchronously or asynchronously 3) communications done in parallel, 4) supercomputer compliant.</p>

<p>Scientific workflows are an aggregation of several tasks exchanging messaging. Usually each task is developed independently as a single piece of software. When integrating these codes into a a workflow, the developer has to build interfaces to exchange data between each task. To get the best performance for a particular workflow, the user should only send necessary data. However, simulation and analysis codes are complex code hard to maintain. It is then desired that the user modify only once their respective code. This imposes that the developer should expose as much data as possible to cover the maximum of use cases. Yet this approach could create significant performance impact due to unnecessary data being send for a particular workflow. We are currently investigating the notion of contracts for tasks. A contract is a declaration by the user of all the data that a particular need to work and all the data that the task can emit. Given this information, we can perform several checks and optimizations. First we check that the user is not trying to connect incompatible tasks with a data model mismatch. Second we can check at runtime that each task is sending the correct data. Third we can filter the data at runtime to send only necessary data for each consumer. This work is currently being integrated in Decaf.</p>

<p>We are investigating convergence between distributed workflows (or
wide area workflows) and in situ workflows. PyCOMPSs is a workflow  engine
developed at BSC aiming at coordinating the execution of jobs in a wide area.
Data exchanges between tasks are done through files. This approach is very
convenient for wide areas but are not suitable for HPC resources. Decaf is a
runtime to describe and execute in situ workflows. Decaf focuses on coordinating
tasks running on the same cluster or data-center. In this context data are
exchanged through memory or high performance networks. We have built a
prototype combining both runtimes where a Decaf workflow is an individual task
in a PyCOMPSs workflow. The objective is to automate the full science pipeline
to discovery by merging high performance in situ workflows (Decaf) with
traditional post-processing methods into a single workflow (PyCOMPSs).</p>

<p>In 2018, our goal is to investigate science use cases of such an integrated
distributed area / in situ workflow system. We have identified one synthetic
example derived from cosmology and one actual example derived from materials
science. In the first case, the in situ workflow consists of three
tasks â€“ synthetic particle generation, Voronoi tessellation, and density
estimation â€“ while the distributed area workflow is a Python plotting task to
visualize the results. In the second case, the in situ workflow consists of the
LAMMPS molecular dynamics code and in situ filtering of molecule clusters while
the distributed area workflow consists of a Python visualization engine.</p>

<p>Current in situ infrastructures often adopt a fixed policy to manage
mismatched data rates between parallel tasks exchanging data. If the consumer is
too slow,  a policy might be to block the producer, slowing down the whole
pipeline to the slowest component, or to drop an entire frame. We built a
communication library called Manala that offers: 1) Possibility to buffer data in several memory
layers, 2) Buffering done synchronously or asynchronously 3) communications done
in parallel, 4) is part of the Decaf project and is compatible with the Bredala
data model previously developed in this project. This work was published in IEEE
Cluster 2017 (missing reference) and was presented by Matthieu Dreher.</p>

the data that the task can produce.  Given this information, we can perform
several checks and optimizations. First, we check that the user is not trying to
connect incompatible tasks with a data model mismatch. Second, we can check at
runtime that each task is sending the correct data. Third, we can filter the
data at runtime to send only necessary data for each consumer. This work is part
of the Decaf project and is compatible with the Bredala data model and Manala
flow control library developed in this project. This work was published in IEEE
Cluster 2017 (missing reference) and was presented by Matthieu Dreher on behalf of Clement
Mommessin.</p>

<p>The data contract idea described above was extended to storage systems. Data
management is a critical component of high-performance computing, with storage
as a cornerstone. Yet the traditional model of parallel  file systems fails to
meet usersâ€™ needs, in terms of both performance and features. In response, we
proposed CoSS, a new storage model based on contracts. Contracts encapsulate in
the same entity the data model (type, dimensions, units, etc.) and the intended
uses of the data. They enable the storage system to work with much more
knowledge about the input and output expected from an application and how it
should be exposed to the user.  This knowledge enables CoSS to optimize data
formatting and placement to best fit userâ€™s requirements, storage space, and
performance. Matthieu Dorier presented a concept paper at the SC17 PDSW workshop 
(missing reference) that introduces the idea of contract-based storage systems and presents some of
the opportunities it offers, in order to motivate further research in this
direction.</p>

<p>Implementing an in situ workflow involves several challenges related to data
placement, task scheduling, efficient communication, scalability, and
reliability. Most current in situ workflow systems focus on high-performance
communications and low-overhead execution models at the cost of reliability and
flexibility.  One of the key design choices in such infrastructures is between
providing a single-program, integrated environment or a multiple-program,
connected environment, both solutions having their own strengths and weaknesses.
While these approaches might be appropriate for current production systems, the
expected characteristics of exascale machines will shift current priorities.
After surveying the tradeoffs and challenges of integrated and connected in situ
workflow solutions available today, we studied how exascale systems will impact
those designs. In particular, we identified missing features of current system
software required for the evolution of in situ workflows toward exascale and how
system software innovations can help address those challenges.  Matthieu Dreher
presented a concept paper at the SC17 ISAV workshop (missing reference) on these topics.</p>

<p>Workflow systems promise scientists an automated end-to-end path from hypothesis to discovery. However, it is impractical to expect any single system to deliver such a wide range of capabilities. A more practical solution is to compose the end-to-end workflow from more than one system. With this goal in mind, the integration between distributed and in situ workflows is explored, where the result is a hierarchical heterogeneous workflow composed of subworkflows, with different levels of the hierarchy using different programming, execution, and data models.</p>

<p>In 2018, we finalized the implementation of this hierarchical workflow composition that uses PyCOMPSs and Decaf as the distributed and in situ workflow tools, respectively. We evaluated our approach by performing experiments in materials science. The in situ Decaf sub-workflow consists of the LAMMPS molecular dynamics simulation coupled to a parallel in situ feature detector that selects nucleated molecule clusters during crystallization. Meanwhile, the PyCOMPSs distributed area workflow launches an ensemble of in situ Decaf workflows with different initial conditions, saves results from experiments that successfully nucleated, and collects frames from those ensemble members into an animation. Our results reveal that heterogeneous workflow integration is advantageous to both distributed area and in situ workflow systems. This work is currently being reviewed for a journal publication.</p>
