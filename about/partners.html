<p>Early in 2004 the Ministry of Education and Science (Spanish Government), Generalitat de
Catalunya (local Catalan Government) and Technical University of Catalonia (UPC) took the
initiative of creating a National Supercomputing Center in Barcelona.
BSC-CNS (Barcelona Supercomputing Center – Centro Nacional de Supercomputación) is the
National Supercomputing Facility in Spain and was officially constituted in April 2005.
BSC-CNS manages MareNostrum, one of the most powerful supercomputers in Europe, located at
the Torre Girona chapel.
The mission of BSC-CNS is to investigate, develop and manage information technology in order
to facilitate scientific progress.
With this aim, special dedication has been taken to areas such as Computer Sciences, Life
Sciences, Earth Sciences and Computational Applications in Science and Engineering.</p>

<p>All these activities are complementary to each other and very tightly related.
In this way, a multidisciplinary loop is set up: our exposure to industrial and non-computer
science academic practices improves our understanding of the needs and helps us focusing our
basic research towards improving those practices.
The result is very positive both for our research work as well as for improving the way we
service our society.</p>

<p>The Jülich Supercomputing Centre (JSC) has about 300 staff members. It provides leading-edge supercomputer resources, IT tools, methods, and know-how for researchers at FZJ and for researchers participating in more than 200 German and European projects through the John von Neumann Institute for Computing (NIC), the Gauss Centre for Supercomputing (GCS) and the Partnership for Advanced Computing in Europe (PRACE). To ensure optimal mapping of methods, models and algorithms needed by users of high-end supercomputing, JSC on the one hand provides - in addition to basic user support - expert advice via its Algorithms, Tools and Methods Labs (ATMLs) in mathematical methods and algorithms, performance analysis or visualization and, on the other hand, in community oriented high-level research and support, the Simulation and Data Laboratories (SDLs).</p>

<p>As a leading research institute in computational science, JSC is involved, to a large extent as founder or co-founder, in numerous national and international research collaborations. In addition, JSC’s research focuses on technology developments in cooperation with industrial and academic partners. This involves exploration of opportunities provided by new architectures, innovative networks or accelerators as well as entirely novel approaches such as neuromorphic computing and, in particular, quantum computing. JSC also conducts R&amp;D in the creation and development of federated systems and infrastructures specifically designed to support the secure, efficient and sustainable management, integration and analysis of Big Scientific Data on a nation-wide, European and international level.</p>

<p>The RIKEN Center for Computational Science (R-CCS) is the leadership research center in high performance computing and computational science in Japan, operating the K computer, and developing the next-gen post-K computer. Our objectives are to investigate “the Science of (high performance) computing, by computing, and for computing”, and promote the core competence of the research in a concrete fashion as open source software, and to collaborate with many other leadership centers globally. The K computer initiated full operation in the fall of 2012 and since then it has continued to produce multitudes of world-leading scientific and engineering results, not only by the academia but also by the industry. Following K’s success, development work started in April 2014 on the successor to K, the post-K computer, with which we aim to achieve not only orders of magnitude increase in our capabilities but also achieve better ease of use and synergy with other IT ecosystems such as big data and artificial intelligence. Post-K is expected to commence operations sometime around 2020, to serve as a keystone for solving some of the most important science and social problems that are of high concern to the general public.</p>
