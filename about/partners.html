      <p>
        The National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) is a hub of transdisciplinary
        research and digital scholarship where University of Illinois faculty, staff, and students,
        and collaborators from around the globe, unite to address research grand challenges for the
        benefit of science and society.
        Current research focus areas are Bioinformatics and Health Sciences, Computing and Data
        Sciences, Culture and Society, Earth and Environment, Materials and Manufacturing, and Physics
        and Astronomy.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Center also provides integrated cyberinfrastructure—computing, data, networking, and
        visualization resources and expertise that are essential to the work of scientists,
        engineers, and scholars at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and across the
        country.
      </p>
      <p>
        NCSA is also an engine of economic impact for the state and the nation, helping companies
        address computing and data challenges and providing hands-on training for undergraduate and
        graduate students and post-docs.

        national security.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through collaborations with researchers here at Argonne and around the world, we strive to
        discover new ways to develop energy innovations through science, create novel materials
        molecule-by-molecule, and gain a deeper understanding of our planet, our climate and the
        cosmos.
      </p>
      <p>
        Surrounded by the highest concentration of top-tier research organizations in the world,
        Argonne leverages its Chicago-area location to lead discovery and to power innovation in a

      <p>
        Early in 2004 the Ministry of Education and Science (Spanish Government), Generalitat de
        Catalunya (local Catalan Government) and Technical University of Catalonia (UPC) took the
        initiative of creating a National Supercomputing Center in Barcelona.
        BSC-CNS (Barcelona Supercomputing Center – Centro Nacional de Supercomputación) is the
        National Supercomputing Facility in Spain and was officially constituted in April 2005.
        BSC-CNS manages MareNostrum, one of the most powerful supercomputers in Europe, located at
        the Torre Girona chapel.
        The mission of BSC-CNS is to investigate, develop and manage information technology in order
        to facilitate scientific progress.
        With this aim, special dedication has been taken to areas such as Computer Sciences, Life
        Sciences, Earth Sciences and Computational Applications in Science and Engineering.
      </p>
      <p>
        All these activities are complementary to each other and very tightly related.
        In this way, a multidisciplinary loop is set up: our exposure to industrial and non-computer
        science academic practices improves our understanding of the needs and helps us focusing our
        basic research towards improving those practices.
        The result is very positive both for our research work as well as for improving the way we
        service our society.

      <p>
        The Jülich Supercomputing Centre at Forschungszentrum Jülich has been operating the first
        German supercomputing centre since 1987, and with the Jülich Institute for Advanced
        Simulation it is continuing the long tradition of scientific computing at Jülich.
        Computing time at the highest performance level is made available to researchers in Germany
        and Europe by means of an independent peer-review process.
        At the time being, JSC operates one of the most powerful supercomputers in Europe, JUQUEEN.
      </p>
      <p>
        About 200 experts and contacts for all aspects of supercomputing and simulation sciences
        work in JSC.
        JSC's research and development concentrates on mathematical modelling and numerical,
        especially parallel algorithms for quantum chemistry, molecular dynamics and Monte-Carlo
        simulations.
        The focus in the computer sciences is on cluster computing, performance analysis of parallel
        programs, visualization, computational steering and federated data services.
      </p>
      <p>
        In cooperations with renowned hardware and software vendors like IBM, Intel and ParTec, JSC
        meets the challenges that arise from the development of exaflop systems - the computers of
        the next supercomputer generation.
        As a member of the German Gauss Centre for Supercomputing, the Jülich Supercomputing Centre
        has coordinated the construction of the European reseach infrastructure "PRACE - Partnership
        for Advanced Computing in Europe" since 2008.

      The RIKEN Center for Computational Science (R-CCS) is the leadership research center in high performance computing and computational science in Japan, operating the K computer, and developing the next-gen post-K computer. Our objectives are to investigate “the Science of (high performance) computing, by computing, and for computing”, and promote the core competence of the research in a concrete fashion as open source software, and to collaborate with many other leadership centers globally. The K computer initiated full operation in the fall of 2012 and since then it has continued to produce multitudes of world-leading scientific and engineering results, not only by the academia but also by the industry. Following K’s success, development work started in April 2014 on the successor to K, the post-K computer, with which we aim to achieve not only orders of magnitude increase in our capabilities but also achieve better ease of use and synergy with other IT ecosystems such as big data and artificial intelligence. Post-K is expected to commence operations sometime around 2020, to serve as a keystone for solving some of the most important science and social problems that are of high concern to the general public.
