## Research topic and goals

Application developers targeting extreme-scale HPC systems such as Fugaku, heterogeneous systems such as MN4 CTE-POWER/ARM/AMD, 
and modular supercomputing architectures such as JUWELS Cluster+Booster, need effective tools to assist with porting and tuning for these unusual systems. 
The XcalableMP compilation system (and directive-based language) {% cite LeeSato2010 --file external/tool_pandt_project.bib %}
{% cite TsujiEtAl2013 --file external/tool_pandt_project.bib  %}, Scalasca/Score-P execution
measurement and analysis tools {% cite GeimerEtAl2010 --file external/tool_pandt_project.bib  %}
{% cite KnuepferEtAl2012 --file external/tool_pandt_project.bib  %} (using SIONlib scalable file I/O 
{% cite FringsEtAl2009 --file external/tool_pandt_project.bib  %}) and Paraver/Extrae/Dimemas measurement and analysis tools {% cite BSCtools --file external/tool_pandt_project.bib  %} are notable examples of 
tools developed by RIKEN, JSC and BSC for this purpose. This project proposes to extend their support for 
JLESC HPC systems and exploit their capabilities in an integrated work flow.  
Existing training material will be adapted to collaborators large-scale HPC systems, augmented
with newly prepared material, and refined for better uptake based on participant evaluations
and feedback. Travel and accommodation expenses of training presenters to participate in
joint training events (such as VI-HPS Tuning Workshops {% cite VIHPSTWS --file external/tool_pandt_project.bib %}) will be supported. 
Collaborative work with application developers will assess the effectiveness of the current (and revised) tools,
and help direct development of new tool capabilities.
