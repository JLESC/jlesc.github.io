## Research topic and goals

The focus of this collaboration is on reducing communication in sparse solvers at extreme
scales. The first phase made some initial steps in forming a communications
model.
Communication costs dominate most sparse solvers leading to sharp strong scaling limitations.
The specific topology of the computation plays an important role in these costs and current sparse
solvers do not take this into account â€” e.g. algebraic multigrid. 
Aggregating communication to align with machine topology can lead to performance gains.
The primary goal is to develop advanced solvers in this direction. The partnership between Illinois and
INRIA through the JointLab will directly enhance this effort.

The project involves Illinois graduate student Shelby Lockhart, postdoc Amanda Bienz, Illinois professors Bill Gropp
and Luke Olson, and INRIA professor Laura Grigori. The work has highlighted
several aspects in moving toward topology-based algorithm decisions. 
The next steps in the project will take a closer look at the performance opporunitities in enlarged Krylov methods.
Currently we have extended the performance modeling to the ECG algorithm and we are detailing the measured performance. 

## Results for 2015/2016

Recent efforts have focused on overlapping communication with computation in the
sparse matrix-vector multiplication operation.  This work led to an
asynchronous SpMV operation that was presented at Supercomputing15 in November
2015 as well as the Copper Mountain Conference on Iterative Methods in March 2016.  

## Results for 2016/2017

The work was extended to aggregate communication at on the nodes and was presented at SC16 and at Copper Multigrid 2017.

The next steps of the collaboration will look at adding pushing the topology aware process to sparse algorithms at INRIA.

## Results for 2017/2018

The work resulted in presentations at the 7th JLESC Workshop in July, 2017, along with presentation of multigrid and sparse-matrix multiplication results at SC17 and Copper Mountain Multigrid (2017) and Copper Mountain Multigrid (2018).  In addition, the main code Raptor, was released as open source.

Grigori (INRIA) serves on Bienz's thesis committee; Bienz is expected to finish in 2018.

The next steps include completing contention modeling.

## Results for 2018/2019

Recent progress has included a paper in review, significant updates to the code
base, and a beta version of a node aware communication package.  Bienz
completed a PhD in summer 2018, with Grigori (INRIA) serving on the final
defense committee.  Shelby Lockhart has joined the collaboration and is making
some initial steps toward performance analysis of enlarged Krylov methods.

## Results for 2019/2020

The recent work as included the extension of the node aware algorithm to the full
algebraic multigrid setup and solve phases.  In addition, Bienz's work has been extended
to collectives.  Lockhart extended the performance analysis to the enlarged Krylov setting
and developed a new communication strategy.
