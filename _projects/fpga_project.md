## Research topic and goals
The end of Mooreâ€™s law poses a significant challenge for
scientific computing: from the mid-2020s, performance will not improve
any more from the CMOS technology progress. Reconfigurable computing
presents the unique opportunity of allowing performance progress by
customization while still serving a large variety of applications,
offering a true co-design vehicle. However, its adoption in scientific
computing still faces the lack of high-level parallel programming
abstraction and the extreme difficulty of achieving high performance
with existing compilation stacks.

We focus on node-level parallelism; and our objective is to
demonstrate, for a set of JLESC applications accelerated with emerging
high-level synthesis technology, significant performance/watt
improvement compared with CPUs and GPUs of the comparable technology.

The advent of high-level synthesis technology such as OpenCL, OpenMP
and OmpSs for FPGAs eases the FPGA adoption process in HPC. However,
we have little expertise to port current existing computational kernel
and have little knowledge on optimizations. In this project, we will
implement key application kernels using high level synthesis tools,
study optimization techniques and conduct performance evaluations.
For optimization, we will evaluate existing source-to-source
optimizers such as Merlin compiler and understand its pros and cons.
We simultaneously study manual optimizations, that are
algorithm-aware, to accelerate kernels significantly.


## Results for 2015/2016
We organized an international workshop on FPGA for scientific simulation and data analytics, at Argonne on January 2016, that attracted application developers, researchers in computer science and applied mathematics, the main FPGA vendors (Xilinx and Altera), and HPC application users.

## Results for 2016/2017
We gave presentations on our FPGA work at the H2RC workshop and the post-Moore workshop in SC16. We organized the second international workshop on FPGA for scientific simulation and data analytics at NCSA in Urbana, Illinois.

## Results for 2017/2018
We presented two technical posters related to high-level synthesis and custom FPGA designs in SC17. We also co-organized a bird-of-feather session about reconfigurable computing in SC17. We have built FPGA test environment for cutting-edge FPGA platforms and high-level synthesis tools.

## Results for 2018/2019
We co-organized a panel session and a bird-of-feather session related to FPGA and reconfigurable computing with our collaborators in this field in SC18. We also organized two workshops related HPC and FPGAs in FPT18 in Japan.

## Results for 2019/2020
Like previous year, we co-organized a panel session and a bird-of-feather session related to FPGA and reconfigurable computing with our collaborators in this field in SC19, which caputured a large audience. We also co-organized the ReHPC workshop in FPL2019.

## Results for 2020/2021
We organized break-out session at JLESC 11th and 12th workshops titled "Heterogeneous and reconfigurable architectures for the future of computing". 

## Results for 2021/2022
We organized break-out session at JLESC 13th workshops titled "Heterogeneous and reconfigurable architectures for the future of computing".

## Future plans

We will study performance portability and code optimization techniques on selected application kernels using the latest generation FPGA platforms (e.g., Intel Arria10, Stratix10, Xilinx Alveo) and possibly submit results to relevant venues. We will study low-level drivers, runtime system, compiler technologies, dynamic resource management techniques and algorithm mapping techniques for future FPGA-enabled heterogeneous HPC cluster platforms.
