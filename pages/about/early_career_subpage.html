<div class="content container my-5">
  <p>The JLESC Early Career Ambassadors (ECAs) represent the students and postdocs working on JLESC projects and attending the workshops.</p>

<h2 id="structure">Structure</h2>
<p>Each JLESC partner institution must nominate one ECA representing the institution’s students and postdocs. The ECA can be supported by deputy ECAs, e.g., first-year, second-year, and third-year PhD students. The group of ECAs within the JLESC is headed by the ECA Mentor. The ECA Mentor role can be taken over by an executive director or an experienced ECA.</p>

<h2 id="onboarding">Onboarding</h2>
<p>The executive director of a JLESC partner institution takes care of recruiting the local ECA. In particular, she/he approaches potential candidates early enough, if an active ECA is about to step down. An outgoing ECA should help the executive director, by suggesting potential successors. Once a new ECA has been appointed, the executive director discusses with her/him the role and responsibilities following this document. The executive director makes sure that the new ECA understands the purpose and tasks of this role and can start acting immediately.</p>

<p>If an active ECA decides to step down, e.g. because of changing positions, time constraints, or leaving the status of an early career, the executive director and the outgoing ECA should talk about the issues/items that are relevant for the successor (network of early careers, documents, mailing lists, open issues, …). Ideally, the new ECA can already participate in this meeting to ensure a seamless transition.</p>

<h2 id="responsibilities">Responsibilities</h2>
<p>The general role of the ECAs is to inform the early career participants of their institutions about the opportunities offered by the JLESC (especially visits and workshops) and to motivate them to explore potential collaborations. In addition, the ECAs shall represent the other students and postdocs at the executive, steering, and scientific committee meetings. They are also asked to participate in the organization of the workshops actively.</p>

<p>In more detail:</p>
<ul>
  <li>ECAs advertise the opportunities of the JLESC to students and postdocs of their institutions, including funding for research visits, attendance of workshops, and participation in projects. The mechanisms used by the ECA to inform and motivate students and postdocs are established locally at each institution and follow each institution’s policies and best practices.</li>
  <li>ECAs need to keep track of students and postdocs participating in JLESC projects, supporting them in their role there (see “Mentoring” section below) and being the contact point in case of problems or questions. A regular meeting between the local ECA, the supporting students (if any), and the early careers participating or interested in JLESC activities is strongly recommended.</li>
  <li>ECAs should exchange information with the executive directors of their institutions, informing each other about problems, improvement ideas, and the current status of projects in which the institution is involved. A regular meeting (e.g., before the executive directors’ conference call) is strongly encouraged.</li>
  <li>ECAs actively participate in the executive, steering, and scientific committee meetings, giving input from the perspective of students and postdocs and feeding information back to them from these meetings.</li>
  <li>ECAs shall be part of the organizing team of each JLESC workshop, contributing actively to the design of the program, the social events, and the support of the participants. In particular, the local ECA of the hosting institution of a workshop has to be included in the local organizing team.</li>
  <li>ECAs play a key role during the workshops, taking over session chair responsibilities, providing social event support, and acting as points of contact for participants, in particular mentoring students and postdocs (see below).</li>
</ul>

<p>A regular exchange of information between the ECAs is encouraged, e.g. during regular conference calls, email exchanges, or chat groups. It is expected that each ECA replies to requests such as emails or chat messages and shares relevant information promptly. The ECA Mentor manages and fosters those exchanges, making sure the communication runs smoothly and uninterrupted. In case of problems or questions that cannot be solved within the group of ECAs or by the ECA Mentor, the mentor shall bring this issue to the attention of the executive directors.</p>

<h2 id="mentoring">Mentoring</h2>
<p>There are two different mentoring schemes related to the ECAs: mentoring of ECAs and ECAs mentoring students and postdocs.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Each ECA is mentored by the ECA Mentor and the executive director of their respective institution. Mentoring in this case comprises on- and off-boarding as well as guidance for the ECA, providing regular feedback and a frequent, general exchange of information.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The ECAs shall mentor the students and postdocs of their respective institutions. This includes in particular getting in touch with them once they participate in JLESC activities (projects or workshops) for the first time and providing guidance during their first steps. If mentoring is desired beyond this point, ECAs continue to act as a point of contact for them, helping them in case of questions or problems. If issues cannot be resolved by the ECA alone, they approach the executive directors to find a solution together with them.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The list of registrations for the workshops will be shared with the ECAs to identify other early-career attendees. Project leaders should inform the ECAs once an early career researcher joins their projects. Also, ECAs actively monitor the projects for new students and postdocs joining.</p>
