## Research topic and goals

Task-based programming models are a promising approach to exploiting complex
distributed and heterogeneous systems. Recently, these models have emerged as a
viable alternative to traditional message-passing and fork-join approaches,
reflecting the research community's growing interest in their numerous
benefits. Despite these advantages, the broader adoption within the scientific
and industrial sectors remains limited. A major barrier is the poor
interoperability among existing runtime systems, which prevents the development
of complex applications through the integration of multiple components or
libraries written in different task-based programming models. Such
interoperability issues often lead to oversubscription, significantly impairing
applicationsâ€™ performance. Maintainability presents another significant challenge within task-based programming models, encountered by projects at varying stages. The relatively modest level of effort anticipated in a future steady-state raises critical questions about the sustainability of support for these models. Can the organization of software, potentially through the utilization of shared code bases for sub-components, facilitate easier maintenance? Such an approach could potentially streamline the support process, thereby enhancing the long-term viability and operational efficiency of task-based systems.

Our project aims to address these challenges by identifying the low-level
primitives necessary for building efficient and scalable task-based runtime
systems. Based on these findings, we will develop unified low-level tasking
interfaces to enhance interoperability among different runtime systems,
optimizing performance and encouraging broader adoption of task-based
programming models.

## Results for 2024/2025

Since the project's inception in September 2024, we have established a monthly video call to coordinate activities and ensure continuous progress.

Our work is currently organized around two main objectives:
* Survey and Documentation of Runtime System Components
We are actively discussing and documenting key components of various runtime systems, including schedulers, dependency management, and communication libraries. This effort aims to identify commonalities and opportunities for cross-runtime interoperability. We plan to consolidate our findings into a survey paper that will highlight similarities and differences among existing runtime systems and propose reusable components that could benefit multiple implementations.
* Porting StarPU and PaRSEC to nOS-V
We have initiated work on adapting StarPU and PaRSEC to run on top of nOS-V. A working prototype of StarPU/nOS-V has already been developed, marking a significant milestone. To further advance this effort, we have secured a summer internship for 2025 in collaboration with Inria and BSC. This internship will focus on improving the integration and evaluating the performance of StarPU and PaRSEC within the nOS-V environment

## Visits and meetings

* We had a BoF session in the Kobe 2024 workshop, where we decided to start this project.
* We are organizing another BoF session at the upcoming Argonne 2025 workshop
* We have planned a summer internship from June to August 2025, from BSC to Inria.

## Impact and publications

* Solve interoperability problems between task-based programming models
* Increase software development productivity and reach of task-based
  programming models
* Research and document needs from higher-level programming systems (Charm++,
  HPX, Legion, OpenMP, OmpSs, ..) for the task-based execution systems
* Explore possibility of creating a standard that allows for different use
  cases currently served,  either via a flexible design or allowing for
extensions
