## About the workshop

The workshop will take place at [ENS-Lyon](http://www.ens-lyon.fr/en/english-ens-de-lyon-269761.kjsp) and will gather top researchers in HPC from INRIA,
the University of Illinois, Argonne National Laboratory, Barcelona Supercomputing Center,
Jülich Supercomputing Centre and Riken-AICS to explore research problems related to
post-Petascale / Exascale Supercomputers and present early results of their joint work.

The workshop will feature technical sessions on five main topics:

* Application and Numerical libraries
* Parallel Programming, runtime and tools
* Resilience
* Big Data, I/O and visualization
* Cloud for HPC.

This will be the fifth edition of this workshop series after [Sophia-Antipolis](http://jointlab-pc.ncsa.illinois.edu/events/workshop11/index.html) (2014), [Chicago](http://publish.illinois.edu/jointlab-esc/2cd-jlesc-workshop-nov-24-26-chicago/) (2014), [Barcelona](http://publish.illinois.edu/jointlab-esc/3rd-jlesc-workshop-june-29-july-1-barcelona/) (2015) and [Bonn](http://www.fz-juelich.de/ias/jsc/EN/Expertise/Workshops/Conferences/JLESC-4/_node.html) (2015).

The workshop will present an exceptional program with papers accepted or submitted to top level conferences. A key objective of the workshop is to identify new research collaborations and establish a roadmap for their implementation.

The workshop is open to Illinois, INRIA, ANL, BSC, JSC and Riken AICS faculties, researchers,
engineers and students who want to learn more about Post Petascale / Exascale Computing.

This workshop is supported by the PUF in the context of the NEXTGN project.

Registration will take place at [http://jlesc2016.sciencesconf.org](http://jlesc2016.sciencesconf.org/).

## On Monday 27th

The workshop begins at _2pm on Monday 27th of June_. The first session (2pm-4:20pm) is
plenary, and we need the large **Amphitheater located at ENS Descartes**. All following

**Registration** also takes place at ENS Monod, 4:30pm-7pm.

Four different rooms will be available for the workshop at the 4th floor of the ENS Monod:
Amphitheater A, Amphitheater B, Room B1 and Room B2. Rooms will be indicated.

**Breaks** and **lunches** will be in front of the **_Amphitheater B_** (3dr floor of ENS Monod) and at the
**_Passerelle room_** (4th floor of ENS Monod).

Except on Monday, **breaks** will be in front of the **_Amphitheater B_** (3dr floor of ENS Monod), and
