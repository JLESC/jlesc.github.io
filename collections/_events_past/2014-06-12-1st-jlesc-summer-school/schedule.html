Modern computing systems have become increasingly complex and large scale.
Understanding their performance has thus become dramatically more difficult than it has ever been.
The aim of this summer school is to provide attendees a presentation of modern tools and techniques
which allow to study the performances of large HPC systems. Four series of lectures (including hands on)
on trace/workload analysis/visualization and system simulation/emulation will be given by domain experts.
Although classical API (s.a MPI, CHARM++, OmpSs) will be used to illustrate techniques, the fundamental
problems remain identical and interesting to any student working with HPC systems and less classical APIs
or applications. <br/> <br/>

              In a first part, we will present the basics of tracing and what the major issues are.
              We will present some of the main tracing environments and try to compare them.
              We will focus on extrae and present some mechanisms that allow to increase scalability.
              We will also describe some of the analysis capabilities motivating such mechanisms and how to use them.
              In particular, we will present a couple of recent developments with clustering and processing sampled data (“folding”).
              We will illustrate the resulting analysis with paraver.
              <br/>
	      In a second part, a few traces will be provided and attendees will have the opportunity of analyzing them or even to obtain traces from their own code if time allows.

             Performance of parallel applications is notoriously hard to optimize.
             This gets even more challenging when running a large number of processors, and/or during strong scaling of an application
             to the limit of its scaling. Fortunately, one can obtain detailed performance data in the form of traces or summaries.
             However, it requires skill and expertise to use this data to identify the major bottleneck that is holding up performance.
             This is further compounded by the “whack a mole” nature of performance debugging: when you fix one problem, another problem
             that was masked by the first one emerges as the next bottleneck.

                 Modern computing systems have become increasingly complex and large scale.
                 This irreducible complexity of creates a large gap between our understanding of the system and its reality,
                 between the facts and our analysis. Simulation is thus an appealing alternative to study such systems.
                 Indeed, in silico studies have proved their usefulness in most other scientific and engineering disciplines.
                 SimGrid is an open source framework to study the behavior of large-scale distributed systems such as Grids, Clouds,
                 HPC or P2P systems.
                 It can be used to evaluate heuristics, prototype applications or even assess legacy MPI applications.
                 It is developed and optimized since more than 10 years and allows to develop simulators that are several orders of magnitude
                 faster than many ad hoc simulators while relying on fluid (coarse-grain) resource models whose validity has been thoroughly studied.
                 These models allow to account for network topology (e.g., contention, performance heterogeneity, communication locality) and resource
                 capacity fluctuations as well as non trivial network protocol peculiarities (e.g., protocol switches, fairness, reverse traffic impact).
                 <br/>
		This tutorial will provide attendees with clear perspectives on the challenges for experimental research in the area of parallel and
		large-scale distributed computing, and on current technology for conducting experiments with real-world testbeds, emulated testbeds, or simulated testbeds.
		It will particularly emphasize on the capabilities and limitations of simulation.

                     Reproducibility of experiments and analysis by others is one of the pillars of modern science.
                     Yet, the description of experimental protocols (particularly in computer science articles) is often lacunar and rarely allows to reproduce a study.
                     Such inaccuracies may not have been too problematic 20 years ago when hardware and operating systems were not too complex.
                     However nowadays are made of a huge number of heterogeneous components and rely on an software stack (OS, compiler, libraries, virtual machines, …)
                     that are so complex that they cannot be perfectly controlled anymore.
                     As a consequence some observations have become more and more difficult to reproduce and to explain by other researchers and even sometimes by
                     the original researchers themselves. Although computer systems are theoretically deterministic systems, the state explosion problem and the inability
                     to perfectly observe and control their state leave no other option than considering them as rather stochastic systems.
                     <br/>
		     Yet, the analysis of stochastic systems is more complex and the graphs provided in articles are generally insufficient to draw solid conclusions.
		     Although simple graphs may illustrate the point of view of the authors, they rarely convey information about the variability of the system, which is
		     yet critical to evaluate how much confidence can be put in the analysis.
		      <br/>
		     In the last decade there has been an increasing number of article withdrawal even in prestigious journals and the realization by both the scientific
		     community and the general public that many research results and studies were actually flawed and wrong.
		      <br/>
		     Open science is the umbrella term of the movement to make scientific research, data and dissemination accessible to all levels of an inquiring society.
		     In particular, it encompasses practices such as the use of open laboratory notebooks and reproducible research, which refers to the idea that the
		     ultimate product of academic research is the paper along with the full computational environment used to produce the results in the paper such as the code,
		     data, etc. that can be u sed to reproduce the results and create new work based on the research.
