The workshop gathered leading researchers in high-performance computing from the JLESC partners INRIA,
the University of Illinois, Argonne National Laboratory, Barcelona Supercomputing Center,
JÃ¼lich Supercomputing Centre and RIKEN AICS to explore the most recent and critical issues
in advancing the field of HPC from petascale to the extreme scale era.

The workshop featured sessions on these five central topics:

* Applications and mini-apps, with a special focus on (but not limited to) molecular dynamics
* Parallel Programming, runtime and tools
* Resilience
* Big Data, I/O and visualization
* Numerical methods and algorithms

A key objective of the workshop is to identify new research collaborations and establish a roadmap
for their implementation.

The workshop is open to Illinois, INRIA, ANL, BSC, JSC and Riken AICS faculties, researchers,
engineers and students who want to learn more about Post-Petascale / Pre-Exascale Computing.
