The workshop gathers leading researchers in high-performance computing from the JLESC partners INRIA,
the University of Illinois, Argonne National Laboratory, Barcelona Supercomputing Center,
JÃ¼lich Supercomputing Centre, RIKEN Center for Computational Science and the University of Tennessee
to explore the most recent and critical issues in advancing the field of HPC from petascale to the extreme scale era.

The workshop will feature sessions on these seven central topics:

  * Applications and mini-apps
  * Parallel Programming models and runtime
  * Performance tools
  * Resilience
  * Big Data, I/O and in-situ visualization
  * Numerical methods and algorithms
  * Advanced architectures

In addition, three keynote speakers will be invited to provide a clear picture of the current state and efforts on the roadmap to Exascale, a vendor session will be organized, and dedicated sessions on hot topics are again envisioned. Special efforts will be taken to highlight students and postdoc contributions: a poster session and a student/postdoc meeting opportunity will be arranged.

A key objective of the workshop is to foster the existing collaborations and inform the workshop attendees of their respective progress, as well as identify new research collaborations and establish a roadmap
for their implementation.

The workshop is open to Illinois, INRIA, ANL, BSC, JSC, R-CCS and UTK faculties, researchers,
engineers and students who want to learn more about Exascale Computing and beyond. Contact your local executive director if you are interested in attending.
