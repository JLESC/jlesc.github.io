The second JLESC summer school was held at BSC from July 2 to 3, 2015, following the 3rd JLESC Workshop

Its theme was on I/O, storage and data analytic techniques.
The school was offered to students (mainly PhD students and post-docs) of the collaboration and open
to students and faculties outside of the collaboration, if room.
Up to a maximum of 24 students were considered.
