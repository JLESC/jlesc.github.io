The workshop will take place at Barcelona, will gather top researchers in HPC from INRIA, the
University of Illinois, Argonne National Laboratory, Barcelona Supercomputing Center, JÃ¼lich
Supercomputing Center and Riken AICS to explore research problems related to post Petascale /
Exascale Supercomputers and present early results of their joint work.

The workshop will feature technical sessions on five main topics: Application and Numerical
libraries; Parallel Programming, runtime and tools; Resilience; Big Data, I/O and visualization;
Cloud for HPC.

The workshop will present an exceptional program with papers accepted or submitted to top level
conferences.

A key objective of the workshop is to identify new research collaborations and establish a roadmap
for their implementation.

The workshop is open to Illinois, INRIA, ANL, BSC, JSC and Riken AICS faculties, researchers,
engineers and students who want to learn more about Post Petascale / Exascale Computing.

## Workshop program

The plenary session will present 3 keynotes, each from a different region (America, Europe, Asia) on
critical issues for Extreme Scale Computing and Data Analytics.

The parallel sessions will cover the following topics:

* Mini apps, Benchmarking, modeling
* Resilience
* Applications
* Programming models
* Performance tools
* I/O, storage, Big data
* in-situ data analytics, visualization
* Numerical Methods/Algorithms.
* Cloud for HPC
