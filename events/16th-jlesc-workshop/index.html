<p>The 16th JLESC Workshop gathers leading researchers in high-performance computing from the JLESC partners INRIA, the University of Illinois, Argonne National Laboratory, Barcelona Supercomputing Center, JÃ¼lich Supercomputing Centre, RIKEN Center for Computational Science and the University of Tennessee to explore the most recent and critical issues in advancing the field of HPC from petascale to the extreme scale era.</p>

<p>The workshop will feature short talk and break-out sessions on these seven central topics:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Artificial intelligence</li>
  <li>Big Data, I/O and in-situ visualization</li>
  <li>Numerical methods and algorithms</li>
  <li>Resilience</li>
  <li>Performance tools</li>
  <li>Programming Languages</li>
  <li>Advanced architectures</li>
  <li>Quantum computing</li>
</ul>

<p>A key objective of the workshop is to foster the existing collaborations and inform the workshop attendees of their respective progress, as well as identify new research collaborations and establish a roadmap for their implementation.</p>

<p>The workshop is open to all participatants from the JLESC institutions Illinois, INRIA, ANL, BSC, JSC, Riken R-CCS and UTK; faculties, researchers, engineers and students who want to learn more about Post-Petascale / Exascale Computing. Contact your local executive director if you are interested in attending.</p>
