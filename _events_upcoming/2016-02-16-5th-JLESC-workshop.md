The workshop will take place at ENS-Lyon and will gather top researchers in HPC from INRIA,
the University of Illinois, Argonne National Laboratory, Barcelona Supercomputing Center,
JÃ¼lich Supercomputing Centre and Riken-AICS to explore research problems related to
post-Petascale / Exascale Supercomputers and present early results of their joint work.

The workshop will feature technical sessions on these JLESC topics:

  * Application and Numerical libraries
  * Parallel Programming, runtime and tools
  * Resilience
  * Big Data, I/O and visualization
  * Cloud for HPC.

The workshop will present an exceptional program with papers accepted or submitted to top level conferences.

A key objective of the workshop is to identify new research collaborations and establish a roadmap for their implementation.

The workshop is open to Illinois, INRIA, ANL, BSC, JSC and Riken AICS faculties, researchers,
engineers and students who want to learn more about Post Petascale / Exascale Computing.
