I"û<p>The workshop will take place at Barcelona, will gather top researchers in HPC from INRIA, the
University of Illinois, Argonne National Laboratory, Barcelona Supercomputing Center, JÃ¼lich
Supercomputing Center and Riken AICS to explore research problems related to post Petascale /
Exascale Supercomputers and present early results of their joint work.</p>

<p>The workshop will feature technical sessions on five main topics: Application and Numerical
libraries; Parallel Programming, runtime and tools; Resilience; Big Data, I/O and visualization;
Cloud for HPC.</p>

<p>The workshop will present an exceptional program with papers accepted or submitted to top level
conferences.</p>

<p>A key objective of the workshop is to identify new research collaborations and establish a roadmap
for their implementation.</p>

<p>The workshop is open to Illinois, INRIA, ANL, BSC, JSC and Riken AICS faculties, researchers,
engineers and students who want to learn more about Post Petascale / Exascale Computing.</p>
