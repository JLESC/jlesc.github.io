<p>Behavior of HPC systems, such as performance, power consumption, thermal
distribution, are increasingly hard to predict due to process variations and
dynamic processors, which conflicts with conventional bulk synchronous
parallelism software models such as MPI. Additionally, computing facilities are
now interested in limiting computing resources by power/energy budget rather
than CPU time. Such idea is also negatively affected by unpredictable behavior
of modern HPC systems. Hardware-level power-limiting capability is becoming a
standard feature in modern processors. Intel running average power limit
(RAPL), for example, adjusts CPU core frequency (and CPU states if needed)
periodically in order to limit the CPU power consumption not to exceed
user-specified per-socket power budget. While RAPL, in fact, is an excellent
mechanism for independent workloads, there are multiple considerations for HPC
usage. The side effect of such power limiting is performance variation between
cores/sockets/nodes; no mechanism to communicate between sockets or nodes. The
effective range of user-specifiable power budget is limited; lower efficiency
with lower power budget. They tend to be a hardware feature; not tuneable.</p>

<p>We propose a software-level solution to provide additional control mechanisms
that increase hardware power-limiting feature and work for multiple nodes by
applying autonomic computing techniques and targeting HPC workloads.  We adopt
an approach involving Autonomic Computing and Control Theory. We will identify
significant sensors and actuators (e.g., switching on/off cores, changing CPU
frequency), build adaptive models of the process to be controlled, and define
robust adaptive control objectives w.r.t. appropriate metrics. We will design
and experimentally validate controllers regulating consumption while ensuring
performance. We will explore variants, beyond simple threshold-based control
e.g., predictive control to avoid overshooting or adaptive control for
robustness to the natural variability, considering costs of actions, avoiding
oscillations and over-reaction, handle multiple criteria, coordinate multiple
autonomic loops. Based on our previous experience in Cloud-oriented Autonomic
Computing, we will generalize and explore novel issues in adapting our
approaches to specificities of HPC and power management.</p>

<p>On the basis of the preliminary work done at ANL on instrumentation of HPC applications, INRIA has begun work on a range of controllers for the runtime adaptation of the Power Cap level in RAPL. A first approach is considered, re-using results on other work concerning a different problem (regulating the degree of parallelism according to synchronization cost), but which could be transferred here. Another approach involves measuring progress and power and making decisions based on predictions.</p>

<p>Argonne completed the design and implementation of an infrastructure to perform
control experiments using Jupyter notebooks. This infrastructure can be
deployed on a wide range of servers, and allows collaborators to independently
implement their own control algorithm using a simple interface and a high level
language. The notebook then connect remotely to the existing Argo NRM
infrastructure, that keeps track of actuators, sensors and application
management.</p>

<p><span class="person given-name">Sophie</span> <span class="person sur-name">Cerf</span> (<abbr title="Institut national de recherche en informatique et en automatique" class="initialism" data-toggle="tooltip">INRIA</abbr>) started working as an INRIA-funded postdoc on this project
in October 2020. Using the Jupyter notebook infrastructure and Grid‚Äô5000, we
are in the process on designing and validating control-theory based approaches
to the problem of power/performance efficiency, with RAPL as the main actuator.
We have identified our main objective for HPC systems: as applications
dynamically undergo variations in workload, due to phases or data/compute
movement between devices, one can dynamically adjust power across compute
elements to save energy with limited and controllable impact on application
performance. We are also focusing on leveraging preliminary work from Argonne
on periodical monitoring of application progress.</p>

<p>We are in the process of publishing our first study, using a preliminary
offline identification process to derive a model of the dynamics of the system
and a proportional-integral (PI) controller, on top of the Argo NRM
infrastructure.</p>

<h2 id="results-for-20212022">Results for 2021/2022</h2>

<p>We published our first study, using a preliminary offline identification
process to derive a proportional-integral (PI) controller on top of the Argo
NRM infrastructure, at Euro-Par 2021 <a class="citation" href="#cerf2021europar">(Cerf et al. 2021)</a>. This study
includes a controller applied to several Grid5000 clusters, and controlling a
singe memory-bound application, using Intel RAPL for power control.</p>

<p>A second publication is in the works, more on the control theory aspects of the
work. Following this, we will work on expanding our control design process to
allow for various types of applications and applications with phases in
particular. The goal is to improve the NRM infrastructure and the controller
design to detect phases in application performance and adapt the control to
them.</p>

<p>We published our second publication, involving results from the MSc internship
of Ismail Hawila <a class="citation" href="#hawila2022ccta">(Hawila et al. 2022)</a>. Observing limitations of our
previous work regarding both modeling (nonlinear models with numerous
parameters) and control performance (mainly instability caused by platform
variations), we developed a novel adaptive control that is robust to the variety
of execution platforms while maintaining the existing global goals of energy
management. It improves the reusability and portability of our controller. We
evaluated, on a real system using the Grid‚Äô5000 testbed, the robustness of the
control to changes in initial parameters and to disturbances, and we compared it
with the previous proportional-integral (PI) control. Our adaptive control
approach allows for up to 25% energy savings.</p>

<p>We continue to improve the NRM infrastructure for robustness, and the
evaluation of our control schemes towards supporting more applications and more
hardware control knobs.</p>

<h2 id="visits-and-meetings">Visits and meetings</h2>

<p>We schedule regular video meetings between the different members of the

<h2 id="future-plans">Future plans</h2>

<p>Initial results on the approach are encouraging, but have highlighted potential
shortcomings of the NRM infrastructure (precision/stability of measurements)
and need to be validated on a wider range of benchmarks. Given the expected
architectures on future systems, we are also planning to evaluate different
actuators than RAPL (i.e. accelerator power capping). We also plan to consider
more elaborate control techniques, to obtain controllers that are more robust
or give a more efficient use of the system.</p>
