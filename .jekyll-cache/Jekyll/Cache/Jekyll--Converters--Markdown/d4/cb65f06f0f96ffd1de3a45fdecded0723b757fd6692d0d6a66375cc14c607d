<p>Simulation-based optimization
in engineering requires high computational power and
may benefit from system heterogeneity. Highly scalable CFD
solvers have been developed at R-CCS and JSC to conduct
large-scale simulations. R-CCS focuses on full-scale
simulations of vehicles aerodynamics. JSC
investigates respiratory flows to improve
medical treatments. Due to massive amounts of data produced, the
analysis of the results is becoming a time-consuming
process. Data-driven approaches have the potential to speed up
analyses or to even replace certain physics in simulations. Deep
learning methods have proven to be a fast alternative to extract
multi-scale features from high-dimensional data
sets. Deep neural networks (DNN) are able to
predict the steady-state flow and aerodynamic coefficients around bluff
bodies and airfoils, and unsteady laminar vortex shedding over
circular bodies. Autoencoders (AE) or generative models, like variational AEs or generative adversarial networks (GANs),
have shown great potential in predicting 2D and 3D flow fields.</p>

<p>It is the aim of the proposed cooperation to tie in with these
topics and to develop methods to efficiently compute and analyze
complex optimization setups in engineering utilizing heterogeneous
architectures. Physics-informed trained networks that allow for
transfer learning are developed. That is, learning starts with pre-trained networks
trained on data with similar features. It is
investigated (i) how such pre-trained DNNs adapt to the various flow
configurations of interest for R-CCS and JSC, (ii) how they can
speed up the simulation workflow, and (iii) how they
overcome a shortage of training data.</p>

<p>Bilateral support activities will lead to
knowledge exchange with respect to the different hardware available
at the partners’ sites, in CFD methods, and in deep learning
approaches. Hence, expertise of the centers in these fields are
strongly promoted in the course of this project. To foster the
cooperation, mutual short-time stays of the involved scientists are
planned.</p>

<p>Due to the CODID-19 pandemic, the activities in the project had to be reduced. Unfortunately, a planned research stay of JSC’s Ph.D. student Mario Rüttgers at R-CCS could not take place. An exchange of research ideas took, however, place online via video conferences (see Visits and meetings below).</p>

<p>JSC was able to continue its work on DNNs. The architecture for such a neural network was developed to predict the sound pressure level in a 2D square domain. It was trained by numerical results from up to 20,000 GPU-based lattice-Boltzmann simulations that include randomly distributed rectangular and circular objects, and monopole sources. Types of boundary conditions, the monopole locations, and cell distances for objects and monopoles serve as input to the network. Parameters were studied to tune the predictions and to increase their accuracy. An optimal choice of the parameters lead to network-predicted results that are in good agreement with the simulated findings. The results have been presented at the International Conference on High Performance Computing - ISC High Performance 2020. A peer-reviewed article has been published in the corresponding Springer series as part of the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS)<a class="citation" href="#Ruttgers2020">(Rüttgers et al. 2020)</a>.
R-CCS contributed with their talk “Distributed Learning for Three-dimensional Flow Field Mode Decomposition on Fugaku” to the 34th Computational Fluid Dynamics Symposium, which was held online on Dec. 21-23, 2020 (K. Ando, K. Onishi, R. Bale, M. Tsubokura, A. Kuroda, and K. Minami). In their research, R-CCS developed and investigated non-linear CNN-based mode decompositioning methods for three-dimensional flow fields around circular cylinder configurations. For the distributed learning, up to 25,250 nodes (1,212,000 cores) on the supercomputer Fugaku were used. Scalable model parallelization techniques for auto-encoder neural networks with a sustained performance of 7.8PFLOPs on 25,250 nodes were implemented.</p>

<p>The still ongoing pandemic lead again to reduced project activities. Nevertheless, both groups from JSC and R-CCS were able to continue their research.</p>

<p>JSC mainly worked on developing and integrating novel AI technologies into their CFD workflows. Reinforcement learning (RL) was implemented for shape optimization problems. For a generic case, i.e., a 2D channel with a constriction, RL was used to satisfy an optimum criterion that is a function of the pressure loss in the channel and the increase of the temperature given by the heat transfer at the channel wall. The work was presented at the International Conference on High Performance Computing - ISC High Performance 2021. A peer-reviewed article was published in the corresponding Springer series as part of the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS)<a class="citation" href="#Ruttgers2021ISC">(Rüttgers et al. 2021)</a>. An application of this technique to the shape optimization of a human nasal cavity is currently ongoing. At the JLESC meeting in 02/2021, the results of automating CFD workflows with a focus on the application to nasal cavity simulation workflows was presented. These results were later integrated into a journal article <a class="citation" href="#Ruttgers2022APIN">(Rüttgers et al. 2022)</a>.</p>

<p>R-CCS continued their work on developing DNNs for mode decompositioning of flow fields. They also participated in the International Conference on High Performance Computing - ISC High Performance 2021, with a talk “Nonlinear Mode Decomposition and Reduced-Order Modeling for Three-Dimensional Cylinder Flow by Distributed Learning on Fugaku”. They used CNNs to perform a parallel mode decompositioning of the flow field and employed long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) to predict the temporal development of the flow via the modes. The performance of this method was evaluated for different numbers of modes. A peer-reviewed article was published in the corresponding Springer series as part of the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS)<a class="citation" href="#Ando2021ISC">(Ando et al. 2021)</a></p>
