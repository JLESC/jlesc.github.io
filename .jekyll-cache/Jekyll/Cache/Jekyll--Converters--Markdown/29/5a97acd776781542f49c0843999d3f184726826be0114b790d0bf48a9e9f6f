<p>The reliability of high performance computing systems is predicted to worsen given current
technology trends, where several errors per day are expected to occur in exascale systems.
Consequently, the software stack that targets HPC systems needs to tolerate faults in order to cope with
the instability of such systems.
Particularly, current parallel programming models, which assume that applications will execute on
failure-free systems, require resilience extensions.
The most popular models used to program parallel systems are MPI for distributed memory
and thread-based models, such as OpenMP, for shared-memory.
Several works have studied faulttolerance methods for MPI applications at the process level such as
the User-Level Fault Mitigation (ULFM) effort at ANL.
Recently, the need for finer-grained levels of resilience arose in the community
because of the space and time overheads of coarse-grained approaches.
Consequently, research in this direction has become more active leading to new methods such as the rollbackrecovery
method applied to asynchronous tasks in the OmpSs programming model.
Despite recent advances, there exists no programming model that offers high degrees of resilience
and low overheads for hybrid MPI+threads applications.
This collaboration aims at providing resilience extensions for hybrid MPI+threads programming models at multiple levels.
At the thread-level, errors are contained within the failing threads except if recovery is not possible,
in which case propagating the failure to the MPI process will be necessary.
The system then will rely on process-level fault-tolerance techniques to mitigate the failure.</p>

<p>There were interactions through telecon between the collaborators which involved discussions
about ULFM for process-level resilience and the feasibility of thread-level fault-tolerance extensions.</p>

<p>We plan to push further the investigation of fine-grained fault-tolerance support in hybrid MPI+threads programming models.
The goal is to answer several open questions including, but not limited to, the degree of granularity suitable for the
fine-grained level (threads or tasks), define the interaction between the coarse-grained and fine-grained levels of
fault-tolerance, the way communication issued by a failed thread should be handled (flushed or ignored), and investigate
the role and necessity of using robust synchronization mechanisms, such as robust mutexes, by the
underlying multithreaded runtime system.</p>
