<p>The end of Moore‚Äôs law poses a significant challenge for
scientific computing: from the mid-2020s, performance will not improve
anymore from the CMOS technology progress. Reconfigurable computing
presents the unique opportunity of allowing performance progress by
customization while still serving a large variety of applications,
offering a true co-design vehicle. However, its adoption in scientific
computing still faces the lack of high-level parallel programming
abstraction and the extreme difficulty of achieving high performance
with existing compilation stacks.</p>

<p>We focus on node-level parallelism; and our objective is to
demonstrate, for a set of JLESC applications accelerated with emerging
high-level synthesis technology, significant performance/watt
improvement compared with CPUs and GPUs of the comparable technology.</p>

<p>The advent of high-level synthesis technology such as OpenCL, OpenMP
and OmpSs for FPGAs eases the FPGA adoption process in HPC. However,
we have little expertise to port current existing computational kernel
and have little knowledge on optimizations. In this project, we will
implement key application kernels using high level synthesis tools,
study optimization techniques and conduct performance evaluations.
For optimization, we will evaluate existing source-to-source
optimizers such as Merlin compiler and understand its pros and cons.
We simultaneously study manual optimizations, that are
algorithm-aware, to accelerate kernels significantly.</p>

<h2 id="future-plans">Future plans</h2>

<p>We will study performance portability and code optimization techniques on selected application kernels using the latest generation FPGA platforms (e.g., Intel Arria10, Stratix10, Xilinx Alveo) and possibly submit results to relevant venues. We will study low-level drivers, runtime system, compiler technologies, dynamic resource management techniques and algorithm mapping techniques for future FPGA-enabled heterogeneous HPC cluster platforms.</p>
