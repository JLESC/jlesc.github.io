I"<p>The workshop gathers leading researchers in high-performance computing from the JLESC partners INRIA,
the University of Illinois, Argonne National Laboratory, Barcelona Supercomputing Center,
JÃ¼lich Supercomputing Centre and RIKEN AICS to explore the most recent and critical issues
in advancing the field of HPC from petascale to the extreme scale era.</p>

<p>The workshop will feature sessions on these seven central topics:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Applications and mini-apps</li>
  <li>Parallel Programming models and runtime</li>
  <li>Performance tools</li>
  <li>Resilience</li>
  <li>Big Data, I/O and in-situ visualization</li>
  <li>Numerical methods and algorithms</li>
  <li>Advanced architectures</li>
</ul>

<p>A key objective of the workshop is to identify new research collaborations and establish a roadmap
for their implementation.</p>

<p>The workshop is open to Illinois, INRIA, ANL, BSC, JSC and Riken AICS faculties, researchers,
engineers and students who want to learn more about Post-Petascale / Pre-Exascale Computing.</p>
