I"h<h2 id="important-notification">IMPORTANT NOTIFICATION</h2>

<p>As the COVID-19 situation is not improving, we regret to inform you that the 10th JLESC Workshop has been canceled.</p>

<p>There is currently not much hope that the situation will allow a safe meeting at Bonn in
April, also due to the close proximity of this area to the German COVID-19 hot spot. This led to the decision to cancel
the event now, helping to minimize travel cancellation fees for all of us.</p>

<p>We are closely monitoring the situation and will inform you as soon as possible about the new dates and location of the
next JLESC workshop. This event website will be replaced soon. We thank you for your support of the JLESC and hope to see you soon.</p>

<p>Kind regards</p>

<p>George Bosilca, Franck Cappello, Bill Kramer, Jesus Labarta, Yves Robert, Mitsuhisa Sato, Robert Speck</p>

The workshop gathers leading researchers in high-performance computing from the JLESC partners INRIA,
the University of Illinois, Argonne National Laboratory, Barcelona Supercomputing Center,
JÃ¼lich Supercomputing Centre, RIKEN Center for Computational Science and the University of Tennessee
to explore the most recent and critical issues in advancing the field of HPC from petascale to the extreme scale era.

The workshop will feature sessions on these seven central topics:

  * Applications and mini-apps
  * Parallel Programming models and runtime
  * Performance tools
  * Resilience
  * Big Data, I/O and in-situ visualization
  * Numerical methods and algorithms
  * Advanced architectures

A key objective of the workshop is to foster the existing collaborations and inform the workshop attendees of their respective progress, as well as identify new research collaborations and establish a roadmap
for their implementation.

The workshop is open to Illinois, INRIA, ANL, BSC, JSC, R-CCS and UTK faculties, researchers,
engineers and students who want to learn more about Exascale Computing and beyond. Contact your local executive director if you are interested in attending.
