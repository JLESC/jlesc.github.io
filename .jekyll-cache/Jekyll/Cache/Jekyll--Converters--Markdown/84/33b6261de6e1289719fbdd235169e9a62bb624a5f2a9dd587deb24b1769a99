<p>JÃ¼lich Supercomputing Centre is recruiting a PhD student in the field
of computer science with a special focus on C++-based tasking approaches.</p>

<p>The goal of this project is the extension and optimization of our C++
tasking framework for current and future HPC hardware as well as its
application to multigrid methods and the FMM. The project is
embedded into the interdisciplinary research setting of the Joint
Laboratory for Extreme Scale Computing (JLESC).</p>

<p>Candidates should hold a university degree in the field of computer science or
mathematics and should have profound understanding of C++
template metaprogramming, with no fear of numerical methods. Social
competence and good communication skills for collaborative work in and
with interdisciplinary teams are essential.</p>

<p>The project runs for 3 years, for more information, please see <a href="http://www.fz-juelich.de/SharedDocs/Stellenangebote/_common/dipldok/d026-2018-jsc.html">here</a>.</p>
