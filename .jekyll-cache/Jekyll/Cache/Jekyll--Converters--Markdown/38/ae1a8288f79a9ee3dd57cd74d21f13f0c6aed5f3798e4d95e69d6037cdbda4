<p>In order to support the work of JLESC researchers, the goal is to leverage the effort and multilateral JLESC collaborations for acquiring 3rd party funding, e.g. via EU or NSF projects.
We will therefore post relevant calls in the news section and encourage everyone to submit further opportunities via their executive director.</p>

<p>Also, please contact your executive director if you are planning or about to submit a JLESC-related proposal.</p>

<p>For now, we start with an <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=503394">overview</a> of NSF calls. In particular, the SAVI call, <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=504756&amp;org=NSF">Science Across Virtual Institutes</a>, is relevant for JLESC researchers.</p>
