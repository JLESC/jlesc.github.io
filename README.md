This is the source repository for the JLESC website.

### What?

The [JLESC website](https://jlesc.github.io) is a set of static HTML5 pages generated with a tool written in [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) called [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com).

### How?

To add or modify the content of specific parts of the website, only a few plain text files written with the [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) markup language have to be edited.

There is one general rule for getting into editing:

> [Read the source, Luke!](http://blog.codinghorror.com/learn-to-read-the-source-luke/)

It all comes down to this: create a pull request and wait for a maintainer to approve, that is:

1. Fork and clone the repository
2. Add new or correct and extend existing content
3. Push your changes to your fork and open a pull request.

There is also a comprehensive guide from GitHub on [sending pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests).
Note that you can [edit](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-your-repository) or even [create](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-new-files/) files directly online, too!

Please read <https://github.com/JLESC/jlesc.github.io/wiki> for much more and much more detailed instructions!
