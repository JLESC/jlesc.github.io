#
# List of Visits conducted by People in JLESC
#
#
# ## Purpose
#
# - data source for the table on `research/visits/`
#
#
# ## Identifier Format
#
# This is a unnamed list of entries, thus there are no identifiers.
#
#
# ## Require Attributes
#
#   from           ID (`_data/people.yml`) of the person traveling
#   start          date of the start of the visit; format: YYYY-MM-DD; consult note below
#   end            date of the end of the visit; format: YYYY-MM-DD; consult note below
#
#
# ## Conditional Required Attributes
#
# exactly one of those has to be given:
#
#   to             ID (`_data/institutes.yml`) of the host institute
#   invitee        ID (`_data/people.yml`) of the person inviting the visitor
#
# Whenever possible, the `invitee` form should be preferred.
# Only in those cases, where there is no clear JLESCee individual inviting the traveling person the
# first form stating the host institute should be used.
#
#
# ## Optional Attributes
#
#   no_exact       give value 'true' if the start and/or end date is not the exact date;
#                  see note blow on those dates
#
#
# ## Notes
#
# - In those rare cases where the exact dates (exact day of month) of the travel can not be given
#   we advice the following procedure:
#     - specify the start date to be the first day of the month the visit started
#     - specify the end date to be the last day of the month the visit ended
#     - add the optional attribute 'no_exact' with a value of 'true'
#
# - stick to a total line length of 100 characters ................................ this is here ->|
#   For longer text fields (e.g. 'topics') use YAML's "Folded style" [1]:
#
#   johnson_j:
#     ...
#     topics: >
#       a really long description spanning
#       multiple lines
#     ...
